Mapping design into LUTs...
WARNING:LIT:176 - Clock buffer is designated to drive clock loads. BUFGMUX
   symbol "physical_group_LCK1_BUF/LCK1_BUFG_INST" (output signal=LCK1_BUF) has
   a mix of clock and non-clock loads. The non-clock loads are:
   Pin I1 of CLK_EN_SEQ1
Running directed packing...
Running delay-based LUT packing...
Running related packing...
Updating timing models...
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net CLK_EN_SEQ is sourced by a
   combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.

Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    2
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:           711 out of  15,360    4%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             1,310 out of  15,360    8%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:            973 out of   7,680   12%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:     973 out of     973 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of     973   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       1,523 out of  15,360    9%
    Number used as logic:             1,250
    Number used as a route-thru:        213
    Number used for Dual Port RAMs:      60
      (Two LUTs used per Dual Port RAM)

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                106 out of     221   47%
    IOB Flip Flops:                      28
  Number of RAMB16s:                      8 out of      24   33%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     5 out of       8   62%
  Number of DCMs:                         1 out of       4   25%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.17

Peak Memory Usage:  188 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  2 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   2 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.
